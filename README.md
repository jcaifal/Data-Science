This repository corresponds to my portfolio of data This repository corresponds to my portfolio of data science projects using machine learning tools, Python, and PySpark.

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and implementing machine learning solutions. Each project includes:

 Project Description: A summary of the problem addressed and the project objectives.
 
 Methodology: A detailed explanation of the methods and techniques used, including data cleaning, feature selection, and model validation.
 
 Results: Visualizations and key metrics that show the performance of the models.
 
 Source Code: Well-documented Python and PySpark scripts that you can review and run.
 
 Conclusions: Reflections on the projectâ€™s findings and potential future improvements.

 

This portfolio not only reflects my technical expertise but also my ability to communicate complex results clearly and effectively. I hope you enjoy exploring these projects as much as I enjoyed creating them.
